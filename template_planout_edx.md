# Title

* include the word "random" or any word containing it as a root, e.g., randomized 
* include the words or roots "education," "learn" or any words indicating that this is an educational trial

## Abstract

* include the word "random" or any word containing it as a root, e.g., randomized 

## Introduction

* Educational problem in the literature the trial is addressing
* Why this educational problem is a gap in the scientific literature
* Bibliographic references in CiTO
* Objectives and respective hypotheses mirroring the gap


## Methods

* Cite RepEd  (**Rep**roducible research template for **Ed**ucational trials conducted on the Open edX platform)

### Participants

* Eligibility criteria for participants and how they match typical learners for specific schools, professinal groups, settings
* Describe edX version and specific key policies and/or xblocks



### Interventions

* Reproducible details of the educational interventions intended for each arm and how and how they were administered
* Provide XML code for course to ensure reproducibility
* Indicate whether intervention in each arm deviate from what would be used in usual educational practice to meet trial requirements

### Outcomes

Clearly defined primary and secondary outcome measures and, when
applicable, any methods used to enhance the quality of measurements (eg,
multiple observations, training of assessors)

Explain why the chosen outcomes and, when relevant, the length of
follow-up are considered important to those who will use the results of
the trial

<!-- outcome should be part of the xml -->

### Sample size

How sample size was determined; explanation of any interim analyses and
stopping rules when applicable

If calculated using the smallest difference considered important by the
target decision maker audience (the minimally important difference) then
report where this difference was obtained

<!-- add code for sample size -->

### Randomization—sequence generation

<!-- add code for sample size -->

Method used to generate the random allocation sequence, including
details of any restriction (eg, blocking, stratification)

#### Randomization—allocation concealment

Method used to implement the random allocation sequence (eg, numbered
containers or central telephone), clarifying whether the sequence was
concealed until interventions were assigned

#### Randomization—implementation

Who generated the allocation sequence, who enrolled participants, and
who assigned participants to their groups

<!-- explain that this was done through edX citing this paper -->

#### Blinding (masking)

Whether participants, those administering the interventions, and those
assessing the outcomes were blinded to group assignment

If blinding was not done, or was not possible, explain why

<!-- explain that blinding was ensured through edx -->

### Statistical methods

Statistical methods used to compare groups for primary outcomes; methods
for additional analyses, such as subgroup analyses and adjusted analyses

<!-- think about partnership with Bayesian statistician -->

## **Results**

### Participant flow


Flow of participants through each stage (a diagram is strongly
recommended)—specifically, for each group, report the numbers of
participants randomly assigned, receiving intended treatment, completing
the study protocol, and analysed for the primary outcome; describe
deviations from planned study protocol, together with reasons

The number of participants or units approached to take part in the
trial, the number which were eligible, and reasons for non-participation
should be reported

### Recruitment


Dates defining the periods of recruitment and follow-up

Baseline data


### Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of each group

Numbers analysed


Number of participants (denominator) in each group included in each
analysis and whether analysis was by “intention-to-treat”; state the
results in absolute numbers when feasible (eg, 10/20, not 50%)

<!-- tables in md -->

### Outcomes and estimation


For each primary and secondary outcome, a summary of results for each
group and the estimated effect size and its precision (eg, 95% CI)

<!-- tables in md -->


### Ancillary analyses



Address multiplicity by reporting any other analyses performed,
including subgroup analyses and adjusted analyses, indicating which are
prespecified and which are exploratory


<!-- tables in md -->


## Discussion

### Explanation and generalisability

20

Interpretation of the results, taking into account study hypotheses,
sources of potential bias or imprecision, and the dangers associated
with multiplicity of analyses and outcomes

Describe key aspects of the setting which determined the trial results.
Discuss possible differences in other settings where clinical
traditions, health service organisation, staffing, or resources may vary
from those of the trial

### Limitations
